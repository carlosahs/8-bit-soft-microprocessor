Special thanks to my professor Rick Swenson for all the support and technical knowledge during the course of the *Design of Programmable Logic* class that 
made it possible to achieve such a project.

In addition, I appreciate the collaborative work I made with my teammates Johan and Jes√∫s. The work we did involved the implementation in code and testing of
the soft microprocessor.
